# Python-Scikit-Learn-PCA-Breast-Cancer
Using PCA to visualize breast cancer data from scikit-learn


The purpose of this notebook was to practise the use of PCA for dimensionality reduction and classification. We downloaded a dataset from Scikit-Learn library. This dataset had 30 feature variables related to breast cancer. The target variable was classified into malignant vs benign. 

We were successfully able to reduce 30 features into 2 principal components and hereby show clear separation between benign and malignant cancers.
